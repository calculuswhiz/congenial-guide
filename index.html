<h3>Preface</h3>
<p>When I first heard of Bitcoin IRA, Inc, it was when I was watching Youtube on my phone. "This has to be some kind of joke," I thought, but sadly, no, it wasn't. This is a real company that wants you to pay real money to buy an extremely volatile asset with your long-term investment using their services. And they're mass-advertising it to the general public.</p>
<p>But some questions were raised in my head. Namely:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Are they convincing people to do this? If so, how?</li>
    <ul>
        <li>Who are they trying to market to?</li>
        <li>What are they telling the general public?</li>
        <li>What are they hiding?</li>
        <li>What's in it for them?</li>
    </ul>
    <li>And of course: Is it a ruse, and if so, how elaborate of a ruse is it?</li>
</ul>
<h3>Motivation</h3>
<p>I am a value investor <s>acolyte</s>, which means I look for things that I think are undervalued and invest in them. In the stock world, this <i>usually - not always -</i> means a low P/E and decent Dividend Yield. But the question I have to ask myself before I buy anything is, "Do I have a good, rational reason to buy it?"</p>
<p>What does this mean here? Well, it means that I have a bias. I do not think Bitcoin is a good investment idea right now in 2017. I do NOT think that Bitcoin is worth over $10K per coin. Some of that bias may come out. Lucky for you, though, this project isn't about that. I will not tell you to buy or not buy Bitcoin. That decision is yours to make.</p>
<p>I will, however, attempt to convince you that Bitcoin IRA, Inc. is a VERY BAD idea. for you if you decide to invest in Bitcoin. In addition, I will show you other, much less costly methods of doing so. Let's get started, shall we?</p>
<h3>The Investigation</h3>
<p>So, let's take a look at their website, <a href="http://bitcoinira.com" target="_blank">http://bitcoinira.com</a>:</p>
<img class="exhibition" src="./img/BitcoinIRAoverview.png" class="snapshot">
<p>At first glance, it looks professional and modern. At least they got the visuals right. They have a neat, avant-garde logo and diagram showing the Bitcoin and Etherium logos. I'm not sure what it means, though, but it looks neat.</p>

<h4>Problem #1: Abusing Outside Quotes</h4>
<p>But let's look at that blurb at the bottom there. It's really a slider with the following three messages:</p>
<img class="exhibition" src="./img/Slider.png">
<p>These all are quite vacuous, but the one I want to call your attention to is number 2: the Investopedia quote. This is really quite a clever little trick. It is threefold:
<ul>
    <li>Investopedia is a fairly reliable source of good information. (I myself use it to look up things I don't understand.)</li>
    <li>Since it is a quote, Bitcoin IRA, Inc. is not liable for false advertising. I looked on other parts of their site. They never claim this themselves, either. For example, at the top they say that they are "IRS-compliant." What does this all mean? Well...</li>
    <li>Let's look at the statement, "Approved by the IRS." Note that it does not say <i>endorsed</i> by. All this is really saying is, "We're following the IRS regulations." However, I get the feeling that's not what they want you to believe. Why else would they put that there if they've already said it? Don't be fooled.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p> The IRS published a <a href="https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p3125.pdf">document</a> declaring at the very top:</p>
<img class="exhibition" src="./img/IRSMessage.png" title="Quite the eye-opener, no?">
<p>I encourage you to read this for yourself. It's good knowledge.</p>

<h4>Problem #2: Reviews</h4>
<p>Scrolling down a bit further, we see the following:</p>
<img class="exhibition" src="./img/Reviews.png">
<p>Yes. They are 5-star reviews. You might think that since these are actual customer reviews, that makes the company more "personable" or "relatable." The problem, however, is that these are NOT people familiar with investing. A large portion of these 5-star reviews are commenting on how easy it is to transfer their 401k's and IRA's over. Still others give "advice" to get in ASAP, or how Bitcoin <i>may</i> be worth a lot more in the future. And of course, the average person would be inclined to believe them. After all, they invested some money in, and they got very high returns back. They must have known what they were doing, right? However, let me leave you with this thought: if Bitcoin had instead lost them money, would they still think it was a good investment? I doubt it. An investment decision should not be judged on whether or not you have made a ridiculous amount of money, but rather by the fact that you made the best decision based on available information.</p>

<h4>Problem #3: The Ebook</h4>
<p>Next on the page, we see this:</p>
<img class="exhibition" src="./img/Ebook.png">
<p>First of all, it's actually one of those things where you have to give them your email to get to the download. Second, it's not an ebook. It's an 11-page landscape-oriented brochure. See that book on the right? It's not real.</p>
<p>Ok, but what's actually wrong with it? @TODO complete this section.</p>

<h4>Problem #4: Clickbait</h4>
<p>Near the bottom, I saw this article (<a href="https://bitcoinira.com/articles/gartners-hype-cycle-proves-bitcoin-not-bubble" target="_blank">link</a>):</p>
<img class="exhibition" src="./img/Fakenews.png">
<p>This article is crap. Yes, blockchain is becoming more widely accepted. The title, however, states that this "Hype Cycle" <b><i>proves</i></b> that Bitcoin is going to go up in value. Ok, look. When you <i>prove</i> something, you show objectively that it is true beyond any shadow of doubt. For example, you can <i>prove</i> that two shapes are congruent. You can <i>prove</i> that the Earth is not flat. You can <i>prove</i> that not everything that is true is provable. Applying this "Hype Cycle" here has several issues:
<ul>
    <li>It provides no numbers and no timeframes.</li>
    <li>It does not account for obsolescence of a technology. Remember the Laserdisc? The Betamax?</li>
    <li>It doesn't match historical Bitcoin price history. There has always been skepticism surrounding it.</li>
    <li>It doesn't account for the fact that the general public doesn't know anything useful about Bitcoin.</li>
    <li>The adoption of technology is not mutually exclusive to overhyping.</li>
    <li>It does not account for technologies that are accepted with little resistance, like the smartphone.</li>
</ul>
Tell me again how this subjective, overly simple model proves anything? All this article serves to do is tell you that Bitcoin is guaranteed to go up, therefore you should use Bitcoin IRA Inc. Never mind that so far, they haven't provided a single good reason for why I should use their services to invest in Bitcoin. I had to dig around to actually find it. The reasons they give are simplicity, no tax on capital gains, and security. I'll break these down next.</p>

<h4>Problem #5: The Hidden Cost</h4>
<p>So if all the deceptive practices listed above are not enough to convince you, let me ask you a question: How much is 15%? Why? Because Bitcoin IRA charges the following fees when you deposit your account:</p>
<ul>
    <li>15% for 15k minimum to 100k</li>
    <li>13% for 100k to 200k</li>
    <li>11% for 200k and up</li>
</ul>
<p>By the way, I didn't find this on their website, and believe me, I looked for it, even under the FAQs and Risk Disclosures pages. I had to find this out through a Google search, where I found <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/traditional-iras-coming-world-bitcoin/" target="_blank">this article</a>.</p>
<p>To put it in perspective for you, I made this little gadget: <a href="./calculations.html"  target="_blank">Bitcoin Investment Comparison Charts</a>. Play around with it for a little while. You'll come to the same conclusions I did.</p>
<p>Who has over 200k in an IRA anyway, or even 100k? I'm speculating a bit here. To catch a thief, one has to think like one, right? So, perhaps a better question would be, "Who would make the ideal target?" The person that comes to mind someone in his or her 40s or up, someone getting closer to retirement. Assuming you can put $5500 away at most per year into a Roth IRA, this makes some sense, as it would take about 10 years with 10%/year consistent ROI to make it to 100k. This, of course, is a more extreme estimate. For many, if not most, this will take even longer, as statistics show that most Americans in their 40s are <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/articles/personal-finance/011216/average-retirement-savings-age-2016.asp" target="_blank">behind the curve</a>. This person would ideally not be very knowledgeable about cryptocurrencies especially since it is a recent technology, and preferably not investment or tech savvy. If the massive ROI potential is spun the right way, you could still sell it to this person. Now don't those discounts look ridiculous? Food for thought!</p>
<h5>My Findings:</h5>
<p>Ok, now for the fun part! Oh, boy, it's data!</p>
<p>Let's profile me. First populate the fields:</p>
<img class="exhibition" src="./img/InputFields.png">
<p>And we get a cool table:</p>
<img class="exhibition" src="./img/Table1.png">
<p>Analyzing this data, the evidence is clear. The investor that is under 59Â½ and expects Bitcoin to go up in price will always profit more from buying from CoinBase. But what about security? That's up to you to decide. Is Bitcoin IRA's security system worth the thousands of dollars? At a minimum, it will cost, effectively, $1000. You lose out even more if BTC goes up or if you deposit more.</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>All right. I think we're ready to answer those questions.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Are they convincing people to do this? If so, how? <i>Yes, as evidenced by the Facebook and Google reviews. They have ads and spread deceptive information.</i></li>
    <ul>
        <li>Who are they trying to market to? <i>People close to the retirement age with fairly large retirement savings.</i></li>
        <li>What are they telling the general public? <i>See article.</i></li>
        <li>What are they hiding? <i>The very high charge on deposits and the speculative nature of BTC. Even though the latter is in the risks and disclosures page, all the "news" articles are trying to tell you that BTC is guaranteed to go up.</i></li>
        <li>What's in it for them? <i>They still profit even if BTC goes down or stays the same.</i></li>
    </ul>
    <li>Is it a ruse, and if so, how elaborate of a ruse is it? <i>I will not go so far as to call this organization fraudulent, I will say that its practices are very unethical. Pretty much everything on their homepage is meant to put up smoke and mirrors. Given a small sample of customers from their joke of a reviews section, it looks like they've duped quite a few innocent people.</i></li>
</ul>
